## Landscape:

### Financial Industry Domains

* Personal Finance
* Investment / Wealth Management
* Mortgage/Real Estate
* Lending
* Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

Since Mogo Inc. is in several domains for the sake of this case study, we will be considering *Personal Finance* as the primary domain of focus.

### Major trends and innovations in Personal Finance over the last 5-10 years:

The top three trends for the Personal Finance domain in the Finance Industry are:

* **Mobile First - Platform**

Mostly driven by the consumer trend overall; Like most industries, the personal finance space has also embraced the mobile first approach.

* **Low / No Comissions Trade**

Driven by rise in competition as well as several technological innovations such as Payment for Orderflow; there has been an ongoing reduction in the all types of fees charged to end customers. This may include Management Fees, Transaction Fees, Annual Maintenance fees, etc

* **Addition of Cryptocurrencies**

Cryptocurrencies have definitely entered the 'mainstream' in the last few years. It's no longer a question of if, but a when will the companies in the personal finance space will support Cryptocurrency as an asset class in their platforms.

### Core Metrics and Performance:

Core Metrics: Based on Q3 Investors Presentation on the Mogo Investor Relationships<sup>[\[15\]](#15)</sup>

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Members 1.8M | Up 64% Year over Year |
| Subscription and Services Revenue | 126% Year on Year over Year Growth |
| Payment Volumen	$2.4 Billion | up 65% year over Year |
| Cash, Investments & Digital Assets | $64 Million |
| Trees Planted | 500K+ |
| Ownership of Coinsquare | \~ 39% |

### Performance in relation to its Competitors:

In general, the other Competitors in the pure-play personal finance space have been doing well. They have macro factors (such as renewed consumer interest in personal finance, etc) supporting their growth.

However the companies in the "Lending" space have taken a hit during the Covid-19 Pandemic.
Following the trend, companies in the lending space have had to recalibrate their earnings expectations resulting from the losses due to pandemic.

Another important factor to be considered for Mogo's performances compared to its competitors is its appetite for Acquisitions and partnerships. Due to such a high "volume" of mergers and acquisitions by Mogo - when compared to its peers; its clear that Mogo Inc management has a clear vision and are still on the path of executing on that vision. The higher than average mergers and acquisitions by Mogo Inc - also implies a higher than average volatility in its quarterly financial statements as seen in their Q3 Investors Presentation on the Mogo Investor Relationships<sup>[\[15\]](#15)</sup>

## Recommendations

### Expanding on B2B

Mogo Inc has several products in the pipleline in the consumer finance world. They could horizontally expand on their B2B Market segment based on their Carta acquisition. They could expand on their sustainability offerings - by offering other financial companies in Canada white-labeled solutions for eco-conscious offerings such as "Planting More Trees" and "Green Bitcoin".

### Upside Opportunity:

Creating and expanding on offering (to other finance companies) in the "Suitability in Personal Finance" space - they have a possibility to multiply their positive ecological impact. This could first be created as a white-labeled option and eventually evolve into a marketplace for finance companies to exchange and build off each others offerings.

### Potential technologies:

It is obvious that additional requirements need to be gathered before discussing the pure-play technology layer. However, as a brain-storming exercise; we could automated B2B offerings using self-executing blockchain based smart contract on a decentralized Hyperledger to really unlock the full potential of a Future marketplace.
The main components of such a solution would include a decentralized Hyperledger/ Blockchain as a foundation, an Identity management layer to enable issuing credentials / smart contracts and the schema of the offerings.

### Advantages of using the recommended Technology:

The use of self executing smart contracts have several advantages such as:

* **Autonomy:** Once defined, these contracts would be self-executing.
* **Steamlined:** The high degree of automation would enable the overlayed business processes to be streamlined
* **Record Keeping:** The use of a cryptographic blockchain would serve as a basis for permanent and non-repudiable record keeping
* **Security:** The Cryptographic encryption typically implies security
